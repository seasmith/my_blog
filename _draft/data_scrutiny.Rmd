```{r ideas}
# ----
# Variable miscues
# ----
#
#   * Mispelling of variable name
#       * Is there a string function to guess what someone may have ment if no #         such name exists (i.e. a user typing `untis` instead of `units`)
#
#   * 
#


# ----
# Unmet data expectations
# ----
#
#   * Data does not span an expected range
#
#   * Data does not include a value for every possible value in a range
#       * How to check that every category or numeric range has some data
#         (i.e. data that spans 24-hrs does not include data points for 2 am
#         or 4 pm)
#
#   * Numeric data contains no non-numeric characters (does not contain
#     string characters)
#       * grepl("[^0-9+\\.0-9+]", var) = numeric
#       * grepl("[^0-9+]", var) = integer
#       * grepl("^[[:digit:]]+$|^[[:digit:]]+\\.[[:digit:]]+$", var) = both
#       * Check that above values are also not NA or Inf
