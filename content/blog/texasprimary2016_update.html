<p>For the past six months I have not worked much on my <a href="https://github.com/seasmith/TexasPrimary2016">TexasPrimary2016</a> project. Recently, since successfully submitting <a href="https://github.com/seasmith/ggloop">ggloop</a> to CRAN, I have picked back up this project.</p>
<p>So far, I have cleaned up the code - better variable names, placing common objects in lists, using better map colors, etc - and renamed some of the files I have been working on. I am planning to use the actual 2016 election data within the project, so I am considering a new name for the project.</p>
<p>Here is an example of one of the new maps:</p>
