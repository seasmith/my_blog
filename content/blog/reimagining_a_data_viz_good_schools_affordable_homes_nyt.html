<p>Last month, a <a href="http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2017/04/sorting-out-whats-meaningful-and-whats-not.html">Junk Charts post</a> critical of the New York Times article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/30/upshot/good-schools-affordable-homes-suburban-sweet-spots.html">Good Schools, Affordable Homes: Finding Suburban Sweet Spots</a>, provided a few recommendations and criticisms for improving the data visuals within the article:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Add a legend to explain the differences in the size of the dots (population?)</li>
<li>Explain the horizontal scale (x-axis = grade above or below national or state average?)</li>
<li>Aggregate the data (by metro area and commute time)</li>
</ol>
<p>I decided to take the NYT data and plot it, while taking into account the considerations above, as best I can.</p>

<h3>Imitating the Original Work</h3>
<p><img src="/blog/reimagining_a_data_viz_good_schools_affordable_homes_nyt_files/figure-html/imitation_1-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the NYT dataset includes metro areas other than those mentioned in the article: Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, and Washington D.C. I did my best to find a “central city” school district and plot that data as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="re-imagined" class="section level3">
<h3>Re-imagined</h3>
<p>I want to show you how the graph above would appear if it were faceted by whether the commute time were &lt; 30 minutes or &gt;= 30 minutes.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/reimagining_a_data_viz_good_schools_affordable_homes_nyt_files/figure-html/imitation_2-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>As you can see, I decided to plot all the data points in the background (good idea if this is a national grading scale).</p>
<p>However, this does not reveal as much as I had anticipated.</p>
<p>Before aggregating the data, I am going to run a very simple linear model (<code>price ~ grade</code>).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/reimagining_a_data_viz_good_schools_affordable_homes_nyt_files/figure-html/reinterpreted_1-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>That still doesn’t quite show the relationship between commute time and relative grade. Though the relationship between commute time and home price become apparent in some cities (i.e. San Francisco).</p>
<p>I went back to the point plot and added an extra facet: commute time ranges.</p>

<div id="aggregated" class="section level3">
<h3>Aggregated</h3>
<p>To aggregate each district’s data:</p>
<ul>
<li>I grouped by:</li>
<li>Metro area</li>
<li>Whether the commute was less than 30 minutes or not</li>
<li>Multiplied each district’s data by it’s residential population and then divide by the region’s total residential population</li>
<li>Summed each grouping</li>
</ul>
<p>It looked something like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  group_by(cbsa_title, `Commute Time`) %&gt;%
  summarize(Population = sum(total_population),
            grade_mean = sum((gsmean_pool * total_population) / Population),
            sale_price_mean = sum((median_sale_price_per_sqft * total_population) / Population))</code></pre>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I had to make a number of assumptions (or ignore certain things) to make the plots above.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The size of the dots appears proportional to the population variable in the data set, and so I mapped the <code>total_population</code> variable to the dot size.</li>
<li>The horizontal axis is some kind of relative grading scale. Sadly, the variable name did not help clarify whether it applied to the entire nation, state, or metro area.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite my limitations, the above graphs now show the scale for dot size, state some information about the x-axis values, and, as a bonus, show all the data points in the background (gray) - which I believe would be a great idea if the grading scale were a national scale.</p>
