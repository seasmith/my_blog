      <description>In September 2016, OPEC announced it’s first production cut in 8 years.
Three months later, Russia, Mexico, Kazakhstan, and Oman announced they would agree in principle to OPEC’s decission and cut their own production.
The cuts have been effective: the December 2017 average price for a barrel of oil was $58. That’s the highest December average since 2014.
With the increase in price comes the incentive to increase production.
Companies within United States may have the most to gain, and they may have the most proven swing producer record, outside of OPEC nations.</description>
