      <description>What is it?ggloop is a package which allows the user to construct multiple ggplot2 plots by passing vectors of aesthetics rather than single aesthetics. Users can pass x, y, and ... vectors to aes_loop(), which like aes(), is a nested function - which sits inside of ggloop(). The pairing, or remapping, behaviors of these vectors are determined by the remap_xy and remap_dots options.
Some quick tipsNested lists or lists of ggplot2 plots can have features added to them by using the special l-plus operator - %L+%.</description>
