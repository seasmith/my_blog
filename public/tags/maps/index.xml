      <description>I have a map of the lower-48 United States - a very detailed map - that I use for choropleths.
Its detail means a lengthy print time, and many of the complex geometries within the map are not needed to distinguish individual states.
Recently I switched to a simplified map by way of the rmapshaper package.
Simplifying the mapSince rmapshaper has sf support, I can load and pass my sf class map directly to ms_simplify().</description>
