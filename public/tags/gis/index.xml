      <description>The following map of Georgia comes from the Washington Postsâ€™ coverage of the 2018 primary elections.
These kinds of maps - where the center of projection is not based on the feature being mapped - are seen quite often in the Washington Post, New York Times, and other major US news publishers.
The map at hand shows the state of Georgia - tilted to the left, as though rotated counter-clockwise about its center.</description>

      <description>I have a map of the lower-48 United States - a very detailed map - that I use for choropleths.
Its detail means a lengthy print time, and many of the complex geometries within the map are not needed to distinguish individual states.
Recently I switched to a simplified map by way of the rmapshaper package.
Simplifying the mapSince rmapshaper has sf support, I can load and pass my sf class map directly to ms_simplify().</description>
