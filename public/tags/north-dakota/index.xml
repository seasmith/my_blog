      <description>From March 29, 1986 to June 19, 2017, a total of 11,826 horizontal oil and gas wells were completed in North Dakota [1]. These wells have produced 2.10 billion barrels of oil in North Dakota.
FieldsOf the 593 fields listed by the North Dakota Department of Natural Resources [2], only 344 (58.0%) have any oil production data from horizontal wells.
In fact, just two fields, the Parshall and Sanish, account for 13.</description>

      <description>The above network graph was produced using ggraph (grammar of graphs), which recently hit CRAN. The graph shows the relationships between rig companies (large red font) and operating companies (small blue font) in North Dakota. The data are from October 2016 to present.
Each line between rig company and operator represents an individual rig. As you can see, some operators employ more than one unique rig from the same company.</description>
