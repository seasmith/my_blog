      <description>The above network graph was produced using ggraph (grammar of graphs), which recently hit CRAN. The graph shows the relationships between rig companies (large red font) and operating companies (small blue font) in North Dakota. The data are from October 2016 to present.
Each line between rig company and operator represents an individual rig. As you can see, some operators employ more than one unique rig from the same company.</description>
