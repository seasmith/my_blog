<p>In March, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-saudi-usa-idUSKBN16U2OY">Reuters reported</a> that Saudi Arabia would be reducing it’s March exports of oil to the U.S. by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd).</p>
<p>In 2009, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 39 refineries imported 973,704 bpd of oil from Saudi Arabia - accounting for 10% of US imports.</p>
<p>However in 2016, 18 refineries imported 1,033,890 bpd from Saudi Arabia - accounting for 13% of US imports.</p>

<p>From 2009-2016, 58 U.S. refineries imported Saudi oil. That’s compared to 224 U.S. refineries that imported any oil (including from Saudi Arabia) during the same time period.</p>
<p>While refinery imports of Saudi oil may have hit their peak in 2012, world imports have generally been on the decline since 2010.</p>
<p>World imports did have a slight uptick in 2016, which also coincided with a halt to the drop in Saudi imports.</p>

<p>As it turns out, not only have the number of refineries relying on Saudi oil dropped, so too have the number of states with Saudi-importing refineries.</p>
<p>In 2009, 13 states imported oil from Saudi Arabia, and in 2016 just 6 states.</p>
<p>Over the entire 2009-2016 time period, 15 states imported oil from Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>While Saudi Arabia, over the 2009-2016 time period, was the number two origin of U.S. refinery imports, its 1,140,314 bpd of exports was nearly 44% of Canada’s 2,545,601 bpd.</p>
<p>Still, Saudi Arabia has overall been one of the top import origins among US refineries, ranking in at 2 (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016) and 4 (2009 and 2010).</p>
<p><img src="/post/exploring_us_refinery_imports_files/figure-html/plot_all_imports_by_origin-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Ultimately, only 8 refineries relied on Saudi oil more than oil from the rest of the world combined from 2009-2016.</p>
<p>That’s compared to 117 refineries which relied on Canadian oil more than oil from the rest of the world combined.</p>

<p>In some individual years (2009, 2010, 2016), some refineries imported only Saudi oil.</p>
<p>However, as popular an origin as Saudi Arabia may be, 0 refineries had imports only from Saudi Arabia during the entirety of the 2009-2016 period. Compare that to 94 refineries that had imports only from Canada.</p>

<p>It will however take a few months before the refinery data regarding the reduction in Saudi exports is available. There is also some expectation that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-idUSKBN17D016">Sauid Arabia wants to continue with the recently agreed upon OPEC cuts</a>, and so the number of U.S. refineries and states importing Saudi oil may continue to decline.</p>
